				<!-- WELCOME TO THE COURSE -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Deep Learning - Week 10</p><br>
					<p>Course starts soon..</p><br>
					
				</section>
				
				<!-- QUESTIONS -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">QUESTIONS</p><br>
					<p class="bigger">Do you have any question?</p>
					<p class="slidewithalotoftext">Questions can be about anything:<br>
						course, exercise, website, problems, tools..</p>

				<!-- PRESENTATIONS -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Presentation of the final project</p>
						<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<li>Each group will make a presentation. Ideally, the presentation would be divided among all members of the group.</li>
							<li>Each presentation should take around 15 minutes. Ideally, 10 minutes are scheduled for the group to show what they have done, and 5 minutes are scheduled for questions and answers. Questions are welcome from everyone.</li>
							<li>The structure of the presentation is not strictly fixed, nor it is its content. However, there are some suggestions to have similar structures.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Guidelines for the presentation <br>(suggestions, not mandatory)</p>
						<ul class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
							<li>(*Optional) Group: who are the people in the group.</li>
							<li>(*Optional) Tools: which tools you used and how you managed to work in a group.</li>
							<li><b>Project</b>: short description of the project and the motivation behind.</li>
							<li><b>Story</b>: attempts, failures, successes, material, resources, whatever happened in the process. Sometimes what did not work can be as important as what worked!</li>
							<li><b>Results</b>: how it works? can you quantify results or show some visualizations?</li>
							<li><b>Baselines</b>: 
								<ul>
									<li>is there a simple baseline with which you can compare? It can be as simple as the mean of the data for time series prediction, or a fixed value of 0.5 for the accuracy in a binary classification problem.</li>
									<li>can you measure human performances on the task? can you personally take some samples from the test set and solve the problem yourself, and quantify the results?</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><b>Missing:</b> is there something you missed to improve the project? Time, material, knowledge, data, computational power?</li>
							<li><b>Future works:</b> do you have an idea how this could be improved or extended?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Sharing is caring</p>
						Would you like to share and make the project available for everyone?
						<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<li><b>Code</b>: is the code online, are you willing to share, can you provide a link to a repository that ideally contains some short instructions to reproduce it?</li>
							<li><b>Data:</b> is the data public, or it is not possible to share?</li>
							<li><b>Presentation: </b>Do you allow me to upload/link the presentation (here I mean the slides) to the website for the next semesters?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- QUIZ -->
				<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
						<p class="slidewithalotoftext">
							1. Can you use transfer learning on your project? To have better results, what would you like the network to have learned before you fine-tune it?<br>
							2. Can you think of a way to use end-to-end deep learning on your project? Or rather divide it into smaller steps? Or none of them fits?<br>
							3. If you had 6 more months on your projects, what would be your next step? Assuming no money/time limitation, would you like to have more/better data, an expert validating your data, a more complex model, a more powerful machine to iterate the hyperparameter search, some time to test and apply different regularization techniques or something else?<br>
