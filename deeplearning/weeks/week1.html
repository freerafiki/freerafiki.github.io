				<!-- PROJECTS -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Projects</p>
					<div class="slidewithalotoftext">
						<p class="fragment">Everybody has to make a project</p>
						<p class="fragment">It does not matter the actual outcome of the project, it is about the experience - only pass or fail</p>
						<p class="fragment">Projects are made in small groups - groups will be made in ~1 month - starting after week 5 session on 18.05</p>
						<p class="fragment">You have the possibility to choose the groups on your own for a week, then we will proceed to group the remaining people</p>
						<p class="fragment">Plan the working environment for the project<br>
							Google Colab, Github, Gitlab, Kaggle, other tools</p>

					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">HOW THE COURSE WORK</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We will follow some coursera courses - you need to create a free Coursera account</li>
							<li>The exercise will be done using Google Colab - you need a Google account (also free)</li>
							<li>We have online session on Zoom every Monday - you do not necessarily need a Zoom account</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
					  <p class="slidetitle">Coursera Courses</p>
						We will follow these 3 courses:
						<ul class="list">
							<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>, </li>
							<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning">Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization</a>,</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning">Structuring Machine Learning Projects</a></li>
						</ul>

						<p class="slidetitle">Zoom Sessions</p>
						<div class="slidewithalotoftext">
							Every Monday at 16.00<br>
							<p class="fragment">1 - We start with a round of questions - everybody can ask the doubts they had</p>
							<p class="fragment">2 - Everybody is given the possibility to answer and discuss</p>
							<p class="fragment">3 - There will be some questions prepared for you, you have some time to discuss <b>in small groups</b> (~5 minutes) and then all together </p>
							<p class="fragment">4 - Exercises: you have some time to discuss <b>in small groups</b> (~10-15 minutes) and then we go through it together </p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section> 
						<p class="slidetitle">How we discuss <b>in small groups</b>?</p>
						Zoom has the possibility to create breakout rooms.<br>
						This means every person will be automatically assigned to a smaller room where you can freely discuss. <br>
						I will try to go around the rooms to help, but I also believe it's nice to encourage discussion between yourself without supervision<br>
						At the end of the time, you will automatically return back to the group call and we will discuss together about it.

				<!-- DURING THE WEEK -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">During the week</p>
					<p class="fragment">Refer to the <a href="https://freerafiki.github.io/deeplearning/">course webpage</a> for material and links.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Ask and answer questions in the <a href="https://chat.opencampus.sh/sose20/channels/deep-learning">Deep Learning Channel in the Mattermost Chat</a><br>
						If you did not join the channel, please do or write me and I will add you.</p>
					<p class="fragment">If you need, feel free to contact me at: <a href="mailto:plmlcu91@gmail.com">plmlcu91@gmail.com</a></p>

				<!-- HAUSAUFGABE -->
				<section>
					<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">For the next week</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Register in the <a href="https://chat.opencampus.sh/sose20/channels/deep-learning">Deep Learning Channel in the Mattermost Chat</a></li>
						<li>Register on Coursera and start the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> course,</li>
						<li>Finish the first week of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">course</a></li>
					</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">(OPTIONAL)</p>
						 If you have enough time, start looking at the second week of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">course</a>. The two weeks are not equally divided, estimated times are ~2 hours for the first week and ~8 hours for the second. Therefore, it may be better to divide in two blocks of 5 hours per week. <br>
						The second week is divided into <b>Logistic Regression</b> and <b>Python Vectorization</b>. Maybe one of the two part could be started already this week, to make it lighter for the next week.
