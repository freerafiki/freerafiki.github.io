							A typical skeleton for a project could look like this.
						</p>	
						<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<li>Read about what has been done in this direction.</li>
							<li>Decide on the tool you want to use. (everybody in the team)</li>
							<li>Find a suitable and well-structured dataset. Pre-process if needed.</li>
							<li>Start testing a very simple model. Start small, and increase complexity gradually.</li>
							<li>Once parameters are tweaked, check it against a baseline.</li>
							<li>Try to improve, if there is time.</li>
							<li>Prepare a presentation to show what you have done.</li>

						<p>
							1. What does having high bias mean? How is this related to the bias parameter <i>b</i>?<br>
							2. Dropout consists in setting to 0 a random number of neurons. Why don't we eliminate them directly and we use less? Is dropout used in training, in testing or in both phases?<br>
							3. What other techniques can you think of to regularize the data and avoid overfitting? How would data augmentation look on your project?<br>

						<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets"><img src="../res/w6/gan.png"></a>
						<p class="source"><i><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets">Generative Adversarial Nets</a></i>, Ian J. Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio, <br><i>NIPS'14: Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems - Volume 2December 2014 Pages 2672–2680</i></p>

						<p>Quotation</p>
						<p class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<i>In the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary: a discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the data distribution. The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine articles.</i>
