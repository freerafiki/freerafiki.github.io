						<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
						<p>
							1. If we use batch normalization, should we stop using normalization before the input layer? Will using normalization result in faster or slower execution at training and testing time?<br>
							2. Hyperparameters search: which one is better between random and grid search? And why? Can you think of a different solution?<br>
