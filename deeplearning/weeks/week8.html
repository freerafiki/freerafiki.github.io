              <section>
                <p class="slidetitle">Project Check</p><br>
                <p>Today we skip the quiz and make a small check about the project, how you started and what your objectives are.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p class="slidetitle">How it works</p><br>
                <p class="fragment">We create Breakout Rooms, and in each Breakout Rooms there are two groups.</p>
                <p class="fragment">The first group has 3 minutes to explain the project, and the other group 2 minutes for feedback and questions. Then group switches and the sceond group explains and first gives feedback. In total it takes 10 minutes.</p>
                <p class="fragment">Afterwards we come back to the main session and each group reports shortly what they learned from the others. So listen carefully.</p>
              </section>
              <section>
                <p class="slidetitle">What should be explained</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The choice of the dataset</li>
                  <li>The choice of the network architecture (if already made)</li>
                  <li>The objective (what you want to achieve)</li>
                  <li>The problems or challenges you face</li>
                </ul>

				<!-- QUIZ -->
				<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
						<p>
                    1. Which approach should you use in your project? 
							1. If we use batch normalization, should we stop using normalization before the input layer? <br>
                     2. Will using normalization result in faster or slower execution at training and testing time?<br>
							3. Hyperparameters search: which one is better between random and grid search? And why? Can you think of a different solution?<br>
