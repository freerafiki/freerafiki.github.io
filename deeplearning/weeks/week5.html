							1. What is the difference between parameters and hyperparameters? Can you make some examples? Is there a hyperparameter that is more important than the others?<br>
                     2. How would you choose the parameters, if you do not know exactly what they do?<br>
                     3. Once we start stacking layers in a neural network, how do we know what layer is doing?
                      Is it important to know?<br>

                     2. Why are using for loop, after talking about vectorization? How would you vectorize the implementation? <br>
                     3. How can a neural network perform worse on training data and better on test data? How important is the accuracy on training data? Do we need it?<br>
