						<p class="slidetitle">Surf Spot Forecast<br>
						with <a href="https://www.windfinder.com">Windfinder</a></p>
						Using weather data and page views from Windfinder, the idea is to predict days and times with good surfing condition in surf spots. <br>
						Page views may serve as an indicator of the reliability of a forecast.

						<p class="slidetitle">Meta Data Extraction<br>
						with <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/">EconStor</a></p>
						
						Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the network should extract information from papers.<br>
						For example, which dataset was used.

					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Bakery Prediction<br>
						with <a href="https://meteolytix.de/">Meteolytix</a></p>
						
						During the corona pandemic, habits did change a lot. <br>
						Is it possible to model these quick changes in the pandemic times?
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Add your own challenge</p>
						
						You are free to add you challenge, you just need:
						<ul>
							<li>Dataset</li>
							<li>Description</li>
							<li>Idea about a possible solution</li>
						</ul><br>
						You do not need to have the solution.

				<!-- QUIZ -->
				<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
						<p class="slidewithalotoftext">
							1. What is the difference between parameters and hyperparameters? Can you make some examples? Is there a hyperparameter that is more important than the others?<br>
							2. What is the difference between FFNN, CNN, RNN and LSTM? <br>
								Which one would you use for processing 1) audio signals? 2) text classification? 3) text prediction? 4) video processing? 5) extracting caption from images? <br>
							3. How accurate can we know what the neural network is doing? Can we know what each level in the network is doing? Why all examples are explained with images?<br>

							We go through the programming assignment that were planned for this week.<br>	
							1. What is <code>np.random.seed(1)</code> ?<br>
							2. Why are using for loop, after talking about vectorization? How would you vectorize the implementation? <br>
							3. How can a neural network perform worse on training data and better on test data? What is the importance of training performances then?<br>
