						<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ</p><br>
						<p>1. What are supervised and unsupervised training? Are there other forms of learning? Which one is more similar to a course?<br>
						2. Is it clear what an activation function is? Is ReLU better then sigmoid? Why?<br>
						3. do you have an intuition about forward and backpropagation? Can you describe it with a real-life example?<br>
						<br>

						<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
							Learning is usually divided into:
						</p>
						<ul>
						<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
							<li>Supervised Learning: all data is labeled, so the network train itself following the labels. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-supervised-learning-54a3e3932590">A brief article about supervised learning.</a></li>
							<li>Reinforcement Learning: the network knows only the final outcome (whether is positive or negative, usually) and there are no label on a single data instance, so it has to decide on itself how to interpret the information about the outcome. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-79ffd92886a7">An article</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgvyzIkgxF0">a video</a> about it.</li>
							<li>Unsupervised Learning: no labels are provided, and the final outcome is also unknown. The network does all the work by itself. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/unsupervised-learning-and-data-clustering-eeecb78b422a">An article about unsupervised learning.</a></li>
							<li>Tranfer Learning: the <i>knowledge</i> obtained training a network can be used for another network for a similar problem, widening the possible applications. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-transfer-learning-8b1a0fa42b4">A super short</a>, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-isnt-hard-anymore-26db0d4749d7">a long article</a> and <a href="https://ruder.io/transfer-learning/">an even longer article about transfer learning</a>. </li>

						<p class="slidetitle">MIXED LEARNING</p>
							<p class="slidewithalotoftext">
								What about mixing supervised and unsupervised learning? It is an interesting open discussion which does not have a definite answer. For more information, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-machine-learning-algorithms-effectively-combine-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning">here an interesting discussion on Quora</a> and a whole book about what is denoted as <a href="http://www.acad.bg/ebook/ml/MITPress-%20SemiSupervised%20Learning.pdf"><i>semi-supervised learning</i></a>. (I did not read the whole book, cannot guarantee about its quality, some chapters are co-authored from Bengio, which is worth trusting). The book is not so recent, but may give you ideas.<br>

						<p class="slidetitle">Activation Function</p>
						<p class="slidewithalotoftext">
							Activation functions are important to regulate the contribution of each level to the network. The non linearity is important to ensure that the output is not just a linear combination of all the networks. <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6">Here</a> there is a discussion about the non-linearity, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/neural-networks-deep-learning/why-do-you-need-non-linear-activation-functions-OASKH">here a video from the Coursera Course, at week 3, about why we need non-linear activation functions</a>. No need to watch now, with some patience, we will get to it, yet I wanted you to have some discussion about it beforehand.<br>
							More in general, a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-neural-networks-1cbd9f8d91d6">more basic </a> and <a href="https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0">more complete article </a> describing different activation functions.

						<p class="slidewithalotoftext">ReLU are <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/glorot11a/glorot11a.pdf">biologically motivated from the activation function used in biology to describe neurons firing in our brain.</a> Plus they actually yield very good results, and now are used everywhere.</p>

						<p class="slidetitle">Forward and backpropagation</p>
							It looked like this topic was well understood. I leave here a reference <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/back-propagation-414ec0043d7">article about backpropagation</a> just in case.
