			<p class="titletext"><b>Material and Resources</b></p>
			<div class="expltext">The course is based on various Coursera courses. It may be seen as a subset of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">DeepLearning Specialization on Coursera</a>, available also at <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">DeepLearning.ai</a> (it may slightly differs).
			However, both specialization has a lot of contents and are not for free (even though on Coursera the course can be audit for free).<br>
			In this course we will go through the first 3 Courses:
			<ul class="list">
				<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>, </li>
				<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning">Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization</a>,</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning">Structuring Machine Learning Projects</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="expltext">The course will make use of the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google Colab</a> tool for the programming part, which allow for a very smooth collaborative working environment with no need to install anything on the personal computer and access to GPU computing. <br> 
			The programming will be done in the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> language. Everybody should have basic knowledge in this language (or Matlab, R and similar) in order to be able to complete the assignment. Working with array and matrices is needed and is very well handled from the <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a> python library.<br>
			In the second week of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning#syllabus">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> course a further insight on vectorization in python is given, so no need to worries if you are not yet very familiar with such operations.
			Some of the concepts explained in the course will require some basic knowledge of mathematics and linear algebra. Again, the first 2 weeks of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning#syllabus">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> course will give hopefully enough examples to clarify the matter. On request, additional bibliography can also be provided.

			<div class="tools">
			<p class="subtitletext">Useful tools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab:</a> online hosting for repositories with version control using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> (this may be annoying at the beginning, but then it's great!). <br>
				They are very similar, with small differences that may be subjective. Lately gitlab has been growing a lot and it may offer more options for deployment and testing of the code.<br>
				I give here references to github, yet the same things can be made also with gitlab, the choice is yours.<br>
				You can use it to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo">create a repository upload your code</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility">keeping it either private or public</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository">collaborate with others</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">create static webpages for your projects</a> (like this one), <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis">create wikis for your software</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions">and much more.</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google Colab:</a> collaborative  coding environment with access to GPU computing power. We will use this during the course - it is strictly related to the coursera courses and provided there as a tool to complete the assignment. It uses <a href="https://ipython.org/notebook.html">Python Notebooks</a> to allow the creation of an interactive document where code and text can be combined.</li>
				<li>Python Notebooks can also be used offline with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/install">installing it on your own computer</a>, and notebooks can be uploaded to github <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github">and they will be rendered as <i>static HTML</i></a>. That means that images and plot you made will be also visibles from others. <br>
				If you want it to be interactive, <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a> is an awesome tool that allows to do that very quickly, and support also <a href="https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/">virtual environments</a>.</li>
				<li>Kaggle: Environment for <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">dataset</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks">notebooks</a> and competitions for Deep Learning. It is very easy to connect with Google Colab. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/general/51898">Here a discussion</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-fetch-kaggle-datasets-into-google-colab-ea682569851a">here an article</a> explaining step by step</li>

			<p class="titletext"><b>FAQ</b></p>
			<p class="faqquest">How can I register to the Mattermost Channel for the Course?</p>
			<p class="expltext">The registration is unfortunately separate from the OpenCampus registration, and can be made here: <a href="https://chat.opencampus.sh/signup_user_complete/?id=yc6wgbqbx3bgxrt5ey1fga1oro">Link for registration</a>.<br>
			You can create a different user account. Once you are registered, please join the <a href="https://chat.opencampus.sh/sose20/channels/town-square">General Channel for the Summer Semester</a> and the <a href="https://chat.opencampus.sh/sose20/channels/deep-learning">Deep Learning Channel</a>.</p>
			<p class="faqquest">Where is the course?</p>
			<p class="expltext">The course is online and will be given via the Zoom platform every Monday at 16.00. The lectures are open, and the link is the following: <a href="https://zoom.us/j/400574033">Link to Join the Zoom Meeting</a>.</p>
			<p class="faqquest">Can I follow the course also if I am not online on Mondays?</p>
			<p class="expltext">In theory yes, but the best parts are the discussion, who will happen online on Mondays. Of course you can follow the online Coursera courses and then ask question on the Mattermost channel and still participate, if you like it this way. </p>
			<p class="faqquest">Will the course be recorded?</p>
			<p class="expltext">No, at the moment this is not planned. The slides will be uploaded in this page and some external links to material and resources may also be available here, but the discussions will not be fully available.</p>
