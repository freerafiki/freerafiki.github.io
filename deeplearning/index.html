			<p class="titletext"><b>Material and Resources</b></p>
			<div class="expltext">The course is based on various Coursera courses. It may be seen as a subset of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">DeepLearning Specialization on Coursera</a>, available also at <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">DeepLearning.ai</a> (it may slightly differs).
			However, both specialization has a lot of contents and are not for free (even though on Coursera the course can be audit for free).<br>
			In this course we will go through the first 3 Courses:
			<ul class="list">
				<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a>, </li>
				<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning">Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization</a>,</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning">Structuring Machine Learning Projects</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="expltext">The course will make use of the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">Google Colab</a> tool for the programming part, which allow for a very smooth collaborative working environment with no need to install anything on the personal computer and access to GPU computing. <br> 
			The programming will be done in the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> language. Everybody should have basic knowledge in this language (or Matlab, R and similar) in order to be able to complete the assignment. Working with array and matrices is needed and is very well handled from the <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a> python library.<br>
			In the second week of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning#syllabus">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> course a further insight on vectorization in python is given, so no need to worries if you are not yet very familiar with such operations.
			Some of the concepts explained in the course will require some basic knowledge of mathematics and linear algebra. Again, the first 2 weeks of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning#syllabus">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> course will give hopefully enough examples to clarify the matter. On request, additional bibliography can also be provided.
